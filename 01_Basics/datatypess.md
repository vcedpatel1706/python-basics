********to write text in vscode   .md(markdown)******

1) not operator in python :
   <> is not supported in python 3, use != instade.
2) click three times to select the current line in vs code
3) shift+0 to change cursor type in vs code
4) to put something in '' or " " , select it and press that ' .
5) to put break on pyhon program we use exit() / quit() / sys.exit().

   break stops the loop and continues the remaining program.
6) if we taking string from user and use it in comparision so it is recomended to convert it into standard form like upper/lower/title/etc.. such that we can do comparision(see ex. in 07_10 problem / problem_5.py)

7) we can't do so ->> 
   a,b=10 (or) a=0,b=10

   have to do a=b=10

8) to swap anything(element of collections/variables etc...)
      a,b=b,a

9) when we dont know about no. of iteration of loop then use while loop

10) if not x:
      ---------

   inner statement run if i is empty

11) apart from print statement ,if we join statement by ',' then it will give o/p as tuple.
      so advisable to join by '+'.(see in 12_oop\problem_4(encapsulation\line-9))

12) to change the indentation of selected code block ;
            ctrl + ]
